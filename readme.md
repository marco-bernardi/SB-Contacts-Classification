## Introduction
The SB-Contacts-Classification project aims to classify contacts within protein structures. This project leverages machine learning algorithms and bioinformatics tools to accurately identify and categorize protein contacts, which are crucial for understanding protein functions and interactions.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Documentation**: Contains the documentation related to the software developed for this project.
- **Software**: Contains the source code and scripts used for protein contact classification.
- **Report**: Contains the detailed report of the project, including methodologies, results, and discussions.

## Usage
To use the software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SB-Contacts-Classification.git
    cd SB-Contacts-Classification
    ```

2. Navigate to the `Software` directory:
    ```sh
    cd Software
    ```

3. Run the main software script (replace `main_script.py` with the actual entry point of your software):
    ```sh
    python main_script.py
    ```
